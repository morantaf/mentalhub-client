## The problem this app tries to solve

In a world of social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, it's hard for people who needs psychological counseling to meet their practician. For some people, this difficulty is present in their everyday life, due to geographical isolation, extreme social anxiety and so on...

The idea of mentalhub came with those people in mind. It's aiming to be the place where patient all over the world can find their online counselor, book an appointment and have a follow up. As a practician, it helps to reach people that wouldn't be reachable by other means.

## Creation of the project

This project was created after completing the Codaisseur Bootcamp.

The bootcamp lasted 8 weeks where we learned web development from the basics of Javascript to the creation of a full stack app using react. During the bootcamp, we learned that technology with class based component. Functional component being more and more used, I decided to learn it ad practice it for that project by reading the documentation
